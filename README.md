# `git-cunt`
Make your repository come right from the down under today with one simple change!

## How the fuck do I do this, mate?
It's piss easy.
```
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M cunt
git remote add origin [your-git-repo]
git push -u origin cunt
```
Or if you want to come here to stay, it's even simpler:
```
git config --global init.defaultBranch cunt
```

## Is this shit licensed under anything?
Yeah, do whatever the fuck you want.
